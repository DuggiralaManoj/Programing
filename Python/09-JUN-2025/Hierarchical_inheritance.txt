Hierarchical Inheritance:
        When one or more child classes are inheritance the properties from one parent class is called hierarchical Inheritance.

Syntax:
        class Parent_Classname:
             #statements
        class Child_class1(Parent_Classname):
             #statements
        class Child_class2(Parent_Classname):
             #statement 

When you want to inherit the attributes or methods from the parent class you need to mention it on child class. 

 You have to create the child class objects how many classes are there.
