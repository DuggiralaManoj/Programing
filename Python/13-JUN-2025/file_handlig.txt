File Handling in python is a way to read write the files from the system.


Modes:

"r" – Read (default). File must exist.

"w" – Write. Creates a new file or truncates existing.

"a" – Append. Adds data to the end of the file.

"x" – Create. Fails if file already exists.

"b" – Binary mode.

"r+" - Read and write a file if it is already existed then its shoes the before file data as read and append the written information or data.

"w+" - Write. and read. I a file is existed then it will clear the data then append the data into that file. By the .seek(0) we can move the pointer to the first passion.
 
"a+" - Append and read. If a file already existed then it will append the data into it when it not existed the it creates one and write that data into it.

.tell() - to show the pointer passion 
.seek(0) - to move the pointer to the starting passion.
