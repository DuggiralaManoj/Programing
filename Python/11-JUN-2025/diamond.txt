What is diamond problem ? How it is going to be solved ?

When a multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance are combined as a hybrid inheritance then the diamond problem occurs ?

syntax: 
       
class A:
      #statements 
class B(A):
      #statements
class C(A):
      #statements
class D(B,C):
      #statements

When the D child class inheriting properties from the parent classes when the parent classes having same method name then which method will child class call ?

In this case we use mro function or mro method to find a way.

From the above syntax by D class it goes to the B class check weather is there any method or not if the D method don't have any the it goes to C class again check weather the method is there are not then it goes to the A class.

mro of D class:

<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>
