What is multiple inheritance?

Inherit the properties from the more then one parent class is called multiple inheritance.

1. Create parent classes the mention the those name in child class parenthesis. Then we can access the methods from the parent classes.

2. If you have you have same method name in all the classes then we have to access it by " Class_name.method_name(object_name) "

3.Without this call we have one process that is "mro (Method resolution order)" that helps to track the how the object going to call a method.

4.We can also call the attributes from the parent class but it only calls the first mention name in child class parameter. We cant access this directly by the object.

 We have to access it by the init method calling 
  Eg: Parent_class_name.__init__(self) 

5.We have to mention the parameter in init of child calls and in init of called parent method if the parent call having any parameter. And pass the parameters in object.
