How to change a existing directory permissions and how to delete the permissions?

1.chomd 755 my_dir  - to change the permissions of a directory.

2.chomd -R 755 my_dir - to change the directory permissions and all its subdirectories permissions.

we have an other way also

By using symbolic Mode:
Syntax:
       chomd symbol+permission_symbol dir_name

u = user (owner)

g = group

o = others

a = all (user + group + others)

+ = add permission

- = remove permission
=
= = set exactly

Examples:

3.chomd u+x dir_name  -to give executive permission to the owner. 

4.chomd g-w dir_name  -to remove write command to  the group members.

5.chomd a=rwx dir_name -to give permissions to all users.

6.chomd u=rwx,go=rx dir_name - same as like 755 command. 

7.chomd -R o-w dir_name  - to remove permissions to directory and to its subdirectories also.

To know the permission of a file we use
8.ls -ld dir_name
